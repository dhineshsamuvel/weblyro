  <h2>Common Problems Businesses Face</h2>

  <p class="small-text">
    Many businesses struggle to attract and convert customers due to a weak or missing online presence.
    Without a modern, high-performing website, credibility drops, engagement suffers,
    and growth opportunities are lost.

    <li>Unclear messaging that fails to communicate value</li>

<!-- WHY IT MATTERS -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>Why a Professionally Built Website Matters</h2>
  <p class="small-text">
    Your website is often the first impression customers have of your brand.
    A professional design builds immediate trust, while clear messaging communicates
    your value without confusion. With a well-structured layout and strategic
    calls-to-action, visitors are guided naturally toward inquiries, sign-ups,
    and purchases—resulting in higher engagement, stronger conversions,
    and long-term brand authority.
